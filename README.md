# Hi there, I'm Prerna üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Data Science with over 5 years of experience in analytics. I have a passion for applying data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Below, you can explore some of my key skills, projects, and professional experience.

## üöÄ About Me

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on <u>building Deep Learning Models(#)</u>, <u>identification and application of Model Compression techniques(#)</u> for <u>Federated Learning(#)</u>, for my thesis.

- üå± I'm actively learning more about [cloud platforms like Google Cloud and Azure](#), [NLP](#), and [automated model deployment](#).
- üëØ I'm looking to collaborate on projects involving machine learning, data analytics, or cloud-based solutions.
- ü§î I‚Äôm currently looking for help with [exploring deeper into data governance](#) and enhancing model interpretability.
- üí¨ Feel free to ask me about any of the work I've done or anything related to machine learning, cloud, and data analytics.
- üì´ How to reach me: You can connect with me via LinkedIn.
- ‚ö° Fun fact: I once reduced customer complaint handling time by 20% using NLP algorithms. I‚Äôm always excited to solve complex problems with data!

## üßë‚Äçüíª Work Experience

### Cloud Migration & Model Automation  
- **Enabled cloud migration and implementation of regulatory models** on Google Cloud Platform to automate models and data management systems.

### Income & Risk Estimation Model  
- **Built machine learning models** using customer transaction data to estimate income & risk, **reducing customer default rates by 25%** and increasing pre-approved loan offerings by 50% (Oracle DB, IBM DB2, Python).

### Impact Analysis Framework  
- **Built and stored a framework for impact analysis** comparing the accuracy of new vs. old models and ensuring regulatory compliance (Dataiku, Pycharm, Git).

### Automated Loan Application System  
- **Built a machine learning model** for automating loan applications, achieving 100% automation in loan underwriting (Alteryx, OracleDB).

### NLP Model for Customer Complaints  
- **Built an NLP model** for prioritized customer complaint handling using the TextRank algorithm, which **reduced handling time by 20%**.

### Bidding Price Prediction Model  
- **Improved model accuracy by 11%** for a logistics client by analyzing output data from a bidding price prediction model using Azure Databricks (SQL, Python, Power BI).

### Model Classification Tool  
- **Created a tool for model classification** to define model risk tiers for both rule-based and machine learning models, automating model segmentation.

### Model Risk Management Tool  
- **Developed a Business Requirement Document** and performed a market vendor assessment to deploy a Model Risk Management tool, aimed at automating processes and ensuring compliance (BigQuery: SQL).

### Data Lineage & Unit Testing  
- **Explored data lineage and performed unit testing** on models deployed on GCP, enabling successful deployment of risk models (Microsoft Excel, JiRA, BigQuery: SQL).
